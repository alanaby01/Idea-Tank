People have priorities..
For example,we have many unwanted messages/images daily as emails,Whatsapps,in Slack,Messanger etc.
Sometimes we may not see what we have to , or events we like..
What if we had a software solely to sort these kinds of messages and show it to us..

P.S : We can lern use priorities probably by ML
